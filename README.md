| But what is a neural network?               | [Article](But%20what%20is%20a%20neural%20network.ipynb)                | [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk&pp=ygUcYnV0IHdoYXQgaXMgYSBuZXVyYWwgbmV0d29yaw%3D%3D) |
| Gradient descent, how neural networks learn | [Article](Gradient%20descent,%20how%20neural%20networks%20learn.ipynb) | [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHZwWFHWa-w)         |
| Backpropagation, intuitively                | [Article](Backpropagation,%20intuitively.ipynb)                | [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ilg3gGewQ5U)         |
| Backpropagation calculus                    | [Article](Backpropagation%20calculus.ipynb)                    | [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIeHLnjs5U8)         |
| Extra: summary article!                     | [Article](Overview%20of%20neural%20networks.ipynb)                 |                                                              |

I've also written an [article on computational universality](Addendum%20on%20computational%20universality.ipynb) that draws from [Michael Nielsen's excellent book](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/index.html) on neural networks. This topic isn't covered in the 3Blue1Brown video series.

I plan to add articles on the videos for large language models and transformers soon.
