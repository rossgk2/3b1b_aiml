    "\n",
    "A *neural network* is a collection of layers of *neurons*. A neuron can be thought of as a configurable miniature machine that produces a number between 0 and 1, called the neuron's *activation value*. The activation values of first-layer neurons are used to store the inputs, and the activation values of last-layer neurons are used to represent the output. Specifically, each last-layer neuron is associated with a pattern that could be detected in the input; if a particular last-layer neuron has high activation while all other last-layer neurons have low activation, then the network \"thinks\" that the pattern associated with the highly activated neuron has been detected.\n",
    "\n",
    "The layered structure is used to take advantage of the the fact that patterns are made up of subpatterns. Specifically, the last layer detects which pattern is present by relying on each neuron in the prior to last layer to have high activation only when its associated subpattern is present. Then, the activation value of a last-layer neuron with associated pattern $p$ is computed as a weighted sum¹ of prior to last-layer activation values. Let us now say \"pattern neuron\" to mean \"last-layer neuron\" and \"subpattern neuron\" to mean \"prior-to-last-layer neuron\". If the weights are configured appropriately (weights on subpattern neurons whose subpatterns appear in $p$ are close to $1$, and weights on subpattern neurons whose subpatterns don't appear in $p$ are close to $0$), then² this weighted sum is close to the sum of activations of the subpatterns that make up $p$. Now, the previous layer, which detects subpatterns, depends on *its* previous layer to detect subsubpatterns in the same way. And so on. So we see it's reasonable to have many layers in a neural network; that each neuron $n$ must have an associated vector (i.e. list) of weights, where each weight describes the strength of the connection from a previous-layer neuron to $n$; and that it makes sense for each neuron's activation value to be the weighted sum of activation values from the previous layer.\n",

    "¹ *The weighted sum of numbers $a_1, ..., a_N$ by numeric weights $w_1, ..., w_N$ is defined to be $w_1 a_1 + ... + w_N a_N$. We \"weight\" each number by one of the weights, and compute the sum of all of the weighted numbers.*\n",
    "\n",
    "² *To restate: given a pattern that's a \"sum\" of subpatterns, then, if weights are appropriately chosen, the activation value associated with the pattern is close to the sum of the corresponding subpattern activation values. One very pleasing mathematical way of saying this, though not quite technically true for a couple reasons, is: \"There is approximately a linear isomorphism between patterns and pattern activation values.\"*"

    "A small sidenote. Currently, we have concluded that the activation values of neurons should simply be weighted sums. Since weighted sums can output any sort of value between $-\\infty$ and $\\infty$, and as activation values must be between $0$ and $1$, then using weighted sums without any modifications will not work. To solve this, we give every layer a nonlinear function called an *activation function*. Perhaps activation functions should be called \"normalization functions\", since their purpose is to resize the results of weighted sums down into the range $[0, 1]$. A very common activation function is the *sigmoid function* $\\sigma:(-\\infty, \\infty) \\rightarrow (0, 1)$ defined by $\\sigma(x) := 1/(1 + e^{-x})$. You may think this function looks complicated; the important things about it are that it maps $(-\\infty, \\infty)$ to $(0, 1)$, that it is increasing, and that it is smooth³. Lastly, we also give each layer a number called the *bias*. This is used to adjust the average activation values that the weighted sums of neurons are typical to have.\n",

Second, imagine the value of the cost function $c$ as corresponding to height above the plane. This way, as we vary $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$ around the plane, the cost $c(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})$ goes up and down in height, and we get a *cost surface*.

The idea of the gradient descent algorithm is to start at the point on the cost surface corresponding to an initial configuration of the network, slightly change the weights and biases so as to take a small step of fixed size in the direction which decreases the cost the most (i.e. the direction of $-\\nabla c$), and repeat.
