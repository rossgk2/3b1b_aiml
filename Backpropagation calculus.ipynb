With the goal of determining the gradient $\\nabla c_i$, we'll compute the partial derivatives of $c_i$ with respect to an arbitrary weight and an arbitrary bias in an arbitrary layer (layer $\\ell$), and find that they recursively depend on the same partial derivatives for layer $\\ell + 1$.

The *backpropagation equations* we obtain recursively determine the partial derivatives for all layers, and therefore determine the gradient $\\nabla c_i$."

And there are several reasons why it should *not* be referred to as \"error\". Most glaringly, partial derivatives such as $\\frac{\\partial c_i}{\\partial z^{(\\ell)}_j}$ are *rates*, and can never rightly be implied to be increment of absolute change, which is exactly what an error is.
